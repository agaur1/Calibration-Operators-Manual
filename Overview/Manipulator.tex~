The SNO+ calibration manipulator is a positioning device used to place
calibraiton sources inside the AV of the SNO+ detector or down
calibration guide tubes in the region between the AV and PSUP. By
using a system of three ropes; a central rope and two dside ropes, the
manipulator is able to position a source on either an east-west (X-Z) or
north-south (Y-Z) plane inside the AV. About 3/4 of the plane inside
the AV can be reached by the manipulator, while the remaining quarter
is not accessible due to physical limits of the manipulator system
imposed by the geometry. In addition to the manipulator ropes, there
is an umbilical attached to the manipulator that provides the
necessary services for the source, such as electrical signals, fibre
optics or gas lines.

Each calibration source is stroed in an Umbilical Retrieval Mechanism
(URM) prior to deployment. A URM

\section{Introduction}

SNO+ uses known optical and nuclear sources to measure its detector
and material properties. The calibration systems deploy sources inside
the acrylic vessel and the cavity.

The calibration of the SNO+ detector can be divided into three
aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calibration of the low level electronics channels (ECA).
  \item Calibration of the phototube timing (PCA).

The calibration systems in SNO+ are are situated in the Deck Clean
Room (DCR) in the SNO cavity at SNOLAB. The clean room exists to
minimize the amount of potential radon contamination. The central
feature of the DCR is the Universal Interface (UI) to the Acrylic
Vessel (AV) that is itself the centerpoint of the SNO+ experiment. The
UI posseses three gate valves through which sources may be
deployed. Two of these gate valves are typically occupied by source
tubes which partially support Umbilical Retrieval Mechanisms (URMs)
which control the vertical deployment of calibration sources. The URMs
are also supported by a beam running across the The URMs
use electric motors and a pneumatic piston to control the movement of
a source by applying appropriate tension on the central rope and
umbilical. The URM is instrumented with encoders and load cells so
that the length and the tension on the umbilical and central rope are
known. In the ideal case for a single axis deployment the tensions are
balanced equally between the rope and the umbilical.

The control of the source positions are supplimented by side
ropes. These ropes are fixed to the inside of the AV and the tensions
are controlled through the use of motors with load cell and encoder
feed back. Sources ride along these ropes on pulleys so that the
relative tension between the central rope and two side ropes guide the
source within a plane. The side ropes are paired to guide the source
in the X-Z plane (using the East and West side ropes) or the Y-Z plane
(using the North and South side ropes).

Further calibration can be conducted external to the AV. A system of
laser fibers are embedded in on the PSUP for the Embedded LED Laser
Injections Entity (ELLIE). This system 

\section{SNO+ Geometry and the Calibration System}

In SNO+ the acrylic vessel is a free floating entity. As such the
equipment used to facilitate the internal calibration of SNO+ is
physically fixed to the AV and so it has a coordinate system that is
also based on the AV position. Measurements by the detector are
collected by the PMT support structure, so there must be a translation
between the AV coordinate system and the PSUP coordinate system. The
dimensions of the AV are given in Table~\ref{tab:avdims}.

There are multiple methods for the measurement of the AV with respect
to the AV. The first is a direct measurement of the top of the UI
relative to the PSUP anchors using a laser level. This requires
opening part of the light seal for the cavity so it is not something
that can be repeated with a high regularity. Measurements using
reflections of light from TELLIE has provided a very good measurement
of the position of the AV with respect to the PSUP. This analysis can
be repeated with the further TELLIE runs. Further measurements can be
completed from the analysis of changes in the tensions on the hold
down ropes although the initial lengths and positions are not well
understood. The results of these measurements are given in
Table~\ref{tab:avpsupmeas}.

The relative positions of the gate valves have been measured with
respect to the top of the AV. In the water phase the gate valves from
SNO were used due to the low tolerances of the gate valves aquired for
SNO+. These positions then give the total distance of the source from
the center of the detector given the height of the source tubes. The
measurements were conducted using a laser level and a measuring
tape and compiled in Table~\ref{tab:guidetubeheight}. Adaptors are
required to accommodate both the 6 inch and 10 inch guide tubes which
have been included in the height differences given.

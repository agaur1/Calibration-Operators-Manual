\section{Purpose}

This procedure describes, step by step, the process of performing an
calibration using the Cherenkov source the centre of the detector in
single axis mode. It is intended as a guideline for operators who have
been trained on the manipulator and Cherenkov. It assumes that the Cherenkov
source is mounted on URM1, located on the 10" gatevalve on the UI
which is located on the south side of the UI.

\section{Outline of the procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prepare the URM for use (turn on N$_{2}$ supply etc.)
\item Flush URM1 with N$_{2}$ gas to remove room air and radon.
\item Calibrate URM1 central rope.
\item Lower source into UI.
\item Deploy source into detector.
\item Take $^{8}$Li data.
\item Retract source into source tube above gatevalve.
\item Shutdown N16 gas board and gas flow to URM.
\end{enumerate}
You will need the following procedures to complete an Cherenkov calibration.

The procedures in this section are intended to be followed sequentially for the Cherenkov calibration except where it is noted that a following step can be skipped. Specifically, if the Cherenkov is to be done in {\it single axis} mode, the side ropes do not need to be attached or detached from the source.

{\bf Prior to Cherenkov}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p1]{} Permission for procedure and confirmation of equipment readiness has been received from the Head of the Calibration Group.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p2]{} Cherenkov is mounted on URM1 which is mounted on the UI 10" gatevalve.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p3]{} The gatevalve is closed and locked (or the handle is removed).

{\bf Readying Cherenkov Source and URM for Operation}

\item \CheckBox[name=li8p4]{} Contact Detector Operator and verify that the DCR activity bit is set.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p5]{} Turn on lights in DCR following standard procedure.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p6]{} Verify that the high pressure N$_{2}$ to the laser is valved off (end of laser, upper right hand corner). 
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p7]{} Verify that all valves on the gas board are closed and the regulator is set to zero.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p8]{} Remove the flush return line on the URM. {\it The presence of the buffer line makes it difficult to measure the O$_{2}$ from the URM.}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p9]{} Check that the flush inlet line is connected to URM1. If not connect it. Open the valve at the source tube. {\it It may be necessary to valve off the other URMs to get sufficient flow.}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p10]{} Verify that the LN$_{2}$ dewar in the junction is at least 1/4 full. If not swap it out with another dewar. Record liquid level of dewar,
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}

\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p11]{} Verify that the dewar gas pressure is above 20 psig. If not, swap it out with another dewar. Unlike the laser the $^16$N does not require a minimum of 100 psig N$_{2}$ is only used for flushing. Note that this dewar won't last long if the pressure is below 100 psig.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p12]{} Turn on the high pressure N$_{2}$ flow from the dewar at junction (Marked {\bf Gas Use} on dewar).
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p13]{} Turn on pressure builder valve (Marked {\bf Pressure Builder} on dewar). {\it The pressure builder valve opens a controlled leak on the dewar to maintain the 150 psig pressure head. If the valve is not opened, the gas pressure to the laser and URM will eventually drop below the operating level (10 psig).}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p14]{} Set up Gas Board in "bypass mode" for "URM flush" only. If you are using the high pressure feed {\bf do not exceed} 10 psi on the regulator. {\it Bypass mod maximizes the flow to the URM. (Gas enters at top left hand corner, flows through the regulator along the outside right hand side line down the URM with all other valves closed --- see the Gas Board Section for details)}.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p15]{} Check that the flow meter (located at the east side of the pipe box) is railed. If not, open the needle valve near the flowmeter fully.\\ {\bf Flush should continue until O$_{2}$ reading at the rear of the URM is less than 0.8\%.} {\it This may take up to an hour depending on when the URM was last flushed.}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p16]{} Once the URM is flushedd the N$_{2}$ supply may be switched from the high pressure dewar to the Wessington dewar. Check with the Operations Group first before switching. Do not use the Wessington if a transfer is in progress. Consult the gasboard section for details on how to switch. If the flush is continued from the high pressure deewar reduce the flow using the needle valve. A setting of 2 full turns above the point where the flowmeter rails is sufficient.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p17]{} Verify (blue) valve on the LI8 Umbilical gas feed line (the translucent line is OPEN. If not, open it.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p18]{} Execute the Cherenkov PMT Turn On Procedure.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p19]{} Do not connect the PMT trigger cable to channel 4, slot 15 crate 17 before obtaining permission from the detector operator.
% \item \CheckBox[name=li8p20]{} Check that the source clamps are in the RELEASE position. There are two clamps. Check both. {\bf WARNING: The clamp positions RELEASE and HOLD are 90 deg apart. Rotate the clamp in the SHORT direction (90 deg) from the HOLD to RELEASE position. The clamp must not be rotated the other way!}\\ {\it The clamps are used to secure the source while the URM is being moved on and off the UI. If the source is moved with the clampes in the HOLD position, it may severely damage the manupulator and the umbilical.}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p21]{} Check the pressure on the air cylinder for the umbilical takeup mechanism. It should be between around 55 psig. {\bf Do not operate the URM if the pressure is below 40 psig.} If the pressure falls below 10 psig at any point (even momentarily) call the OCE. An internal inspection of the URM is mandatory before operating the unit again. {\it The pressure cylinder on the URM maintains tension on the umbilical takeup reel. A low gas pressure can result in the umbilical falling off the takeup reel and getting caught or jammed leading to destruction of the umbilical.} 
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p22]{} Verify that the 10'' gate valve is closed and locked (or handle is removed). {\it The valve is CLOSED when the handle points towards the pipebox and the slot on the handle stem points AWAY from the source tube.} % Note this will change with the new gate valves
\item \CheckBox[name=li8p23]{} Calibrate Central Rope Length (see procedure {\it Central Rope Position Calibration}). Record changes in length of central rope and umbilical. The current fiducial mark for URM1 on gatevate 3 is 
\[
z_{mark} = 1548.95
\]
Note: the fiducial mark is written on the source tube. If it differs from the above number use what is written on the source tube.

\item \CheckBox[name=li8p24]{} Check that all seals are in place on the URM. Including:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \CheckBox[name=li8p24a]{} flush inlet line
	\item \CheckBox[name=li8p24b]{} window on front of URM motorbox

	\end{itemize}
{\it Note that the flush outlet is small enough and is small enough that it does not pose a threat to the detector unless light is shone directly into it.}
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Deploying Source from Source Tube Into Glovebox}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d1]{} Verify that the URM is below approximately 0.8\% O$_{2}$.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d2]{} Check that the flush return line is connected to URM1. If not, connect it.
{\it It may be necessary to move it from another URM.}

\end{center}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d7]{} Remove handle and key for the 10'' gatevalve and place {\bf Gatevalve Open} sign on valve.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d8]{} With a flashligh perform light leak check on URM. In particular check the seal of the source tube window and around the base of the source tube. Also, check around any inspection panel which may have been removed in the recent past.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d9]{} Bring up breaker 9 lights in the DCR with the detector operator watching the detector. If everything is okay bring up the other breakers. {\bf If there is any sign of a lightleak turn off the DCR lights immediately, close the gatevalve, and contact the OCE.}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d12]{} Orca is in a {\bf source transitional run}.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d13]{} Verify that {\bf manip\_logger} is running on the {\bf calibration} computer and logging the {\bf LI8} source. This can be verified by opening \url{http://couch.ug.snopl.us/manip/_all_docs} and searching for the current date.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d14]{} Check movement of li8 down:
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	console & \verb+manip > li8 by 0 0 -5+ \\
	manmon & in Li8 window: \\
	& set x= 0, y= 0, z= -5 \\
	& click on {\bf move by} \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
{\it The Li8 should move down 5~cm. The tension on the rope should be 90-110~N. The tension on the umbilical should be 10-40~N.}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8d15]{} Deploy source into the UI:
	\begin{center}

	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Deploying Manipulator into Centre of Detector from UI}
	
\begin{enumerate}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8c1]{} Contact Water Supervisor and advise him/her that the source is being lowered into the AV. {\it The water group maintains a very small differential pressure between the fluids inside and outside of the AV. The volume of the source is enough to disrupt this differential pressure and could result in and SDS trip.}
\item \CheckBox[name=li8c2]{} Check tensions on URM1ROPE and
  URM1UMBILICAL. Rope tensions in air should be approximately 70-90~N. Umbilical tension should be 60-80~N.
\item \CheckBox[name=li8c3]{} Move LI8 to centre of detector.
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	console & \verb+manip > li8 to 0 0 50+ \\

	& click on {\bf Position the source} \\
	& set x= 0, y= 0, z= 0 \\
	& click on {\bf move to} \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
As the source goes into the water, the rope tension will decrease to approximately 30~N and the umbilical to approximately 16~N

	\end{center}
{\it If sideropes are attached move the source to approximately z=1370 and disconnect the sideropes before retracting the source any further. See the siderope procedures. When moving the LI8 to 1370, it is important to make sure you are moving the {\bf pivot}, not the centre of the source which is approximately 50 cm below the pivot. This is especially important if the sideropes are attached!}
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Retracting the Source Above the Gate Valve. Side Ropes NOT Attached}

{\it The Cherenkov source is a tight fit. Specifically the width of
  only just fits inside the flange. Make sure to always gently guide
